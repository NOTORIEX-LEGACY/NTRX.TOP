                    <p>Hello visitor! Do you play Trackmania United Forever or Nations Forever? Well there is a legit fix for blurry textures! This does not include setting DISTRO = MILIN as that is not the genuine fix! The problem with the game is that if you look into your settings, it would say that your graphics card has a couple hundred MBs right? That's actually an inaccurate display of your computer's VRAM. This article explains on how to fix it! At least with this fix, you are able to use anti-aliasing without any problems!<br>If you do, however, keep seeing popups about benchmarking when accessing the settings again, that is totally fine! It is suggested to set anti-aliasing to 4x or 8x!</p>
